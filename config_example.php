# Optional manifest group that specifies who can see the names of
# occupants in a building.  If no group is specified for a building,
# this configuration setting does not limit visibility.  Multiple
# groups may be listed for a building by using an array of strings
# rather than a single string; if the viewer does not match any
# group, visibility is restricted.  Note that people can always
# see their own name.
#
# The manifest groups must be linked to shibboleth on your website.
# See https://kb.wisc.edu/26440 for tips on how to set that up.
# Basically, just create a new group and paste the shibboleth entityID
# into the SAML2 entity ID field under Advanced Options.  See
# https://kb.wisc.edu/30150 for tips on how to use UDDS employee lists
# in manifest groups.  An example: create a group and then after
# clicking Add Members, enter something like
# uw:ref:hr_system:job:current:udds:A:A48:A4812:all_A4812 in the 'Add
# group member' field.  Wait a minute for the spinny thing to stop
# spinning, then select the group from the drop-down list that
# appears, and then click Save.  Note that existing shibboleth
# sessions do not get updated when you change the manifest
# configuration.  It can also take a few minutes for changed manifest
# configuration to take effect even for newly created sessions.
#
# Note that if you wish to restrict access to the form altogether
# rather than just anonymizing occupants, you can add an entry in
# .htaccess of the form:
# require shib-attr isMemberOf <your manifest group>
