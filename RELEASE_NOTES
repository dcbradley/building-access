* Added SHOW_ANONYMOUS_ROOM_OCCUPANCY, which can be set to false
  to hide from the occupancy list rooms occupied by anonymous
  people.  Default true, which matches the previous behavior.

* For auditing purposes, log all registration actions, including
  creation, update, and deletion in the web server log.  When an admin
  performs the action on behalf of someone else, this is clearly
  indicated.

* Allow admins to change the name and email address associated
  with a registration.

* Added 'Act As' feature for admins to temporarily become
  someone else.  To disable, set ALLOW_ADMIN_ACT_AS=false.

* Allow repeating registrations to be placed up to three
  months from the current one.

* Add approve all and deny all checkboxes on the approval form.

* Fixed error causing failure to submit a repeating registration
  when mysql is in strict mode.

* Preserve the contents of the registration form when changing the date.

* Added occupancy map on the administrative approval page.

* Added configuration settings DEFAULT_PRIVACY (default false) and
  USER_SETTABLE_PRIVACY (default false).  If USER_SETTABLE_PRIVACY
  is set to true, a column needs to be added to the
  database.  Example mysql command:
  alter table building_access add column PRIVACY char(1) not null default '';

* Make it clear that the app title can changed by setting
  WEB_APP_TITLE in config.php.

* Allow the About page to be disabled by configuring ABOUT_PAGE =
  null.

* Allow occupants to be anonymized based on manifest group membership.
  See BUILDING_VISIBILITY_MANIFEST_GROUP in config_example.php.
